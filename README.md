# What is this?
This repository contains my settings for the two very popular browser extensions uMatrix and uBlock Originand my full hosts file.

# What are the contents of the files?
In this section I will be briefly talking about what each of the files located inside this repository contains.

## uBlock Origin
The uBlock Origin file is rather straightforward and not much has changed from its regular version.

## uMatrix
The uMatrix file contains a lot of personal settings for websites I visit frequently. It also contains a rather extensive list of website I outright refuse to look at or browse to. This includes spam websites but also things such as Google or social media

## Hosts
The hosts file is not quite unlike the uMatrix one, with the difference being that it blocks websites on a system-wide basis rather than merely inside the browser. However, saying that it "blocks" them is perhaps a misnomer. Rather, it redirects all attempts of accessing any of the sites located inside of it to "localhosts". One could in theory set up a server that would display a custom error message. If that's not the case, the browser will merely say that it is unable to connect to the website and it usually asks you whether you are connected to the internet.
The host file contains a large number of domains; over 50,000 in fact. Amongst these domains are spam and ads, porn, social media, gambling and fake news. Therefore, here is a warning to all of you who might want to use it:
> ** WARNING ** : _If you replace your hosts file with this one, a lot of the websites you are accustomed tomay no longer be visitable. Be advised!_

The hosts file comes with a few comments which should help you filter out and remove the websites which you would still like to visit, therefore I wholly recommend you read the top of the file before doing anything.
